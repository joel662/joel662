## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### 🕶️ **VR Digital Twin – Sustainable Green Hotel Simulation**
A large-scale VR digital twin project that simulates the physical layout, airflow, water flow, temperature dynamics, and energy efficiency of a proposed sustainable hotel near Toronto Pearson Airport.

**Tech & Responsibilities**
- Built in **Unity** with immersive interactions, dynamic UI, and optimized rendering  
- Integrated **AI-driven 3D model generation** pipelines to convert architect 2D designs into 3D scenes  
- Designed player navigation, teleportation, and interactive environment elements  
- Implemented real-time simulation behavior for sustainability features (green roofs, solar, HVAC, airflow logic)

### 🎮 **VR Interaction Systems – Unreal Engine (VR Expansion Plugin)**
A collection of VR mechanics developed in Unreal Engine for immersive gameplay:

**Key Mechanics**
- **VR Grabbing System** — physics-based grabbing using VR Expansion Plugin  
- **VR Movement & Head Tracking** — smooth locomotion, player height adjustment, and controller-based rotations  
- **Grappling Hook Mechanic** — custom physics-based system that pulls the player when the Meta controller trigger is pressed  
- **Custom Interaction Blueprints** — door handles, levers, climbable objects, and distance-based interaction cues  

This work is part of upgrading a traditional UE first-person project into a fully immersive VR experience.

### 🧱 **VR Construction Interaction Tool**
A utility that allows dragging, dropping, and generating custom JSON-based diagrammatic objects in VR for prototyping various interactive elements.

**Features**
- Real-time diagram rendering using PixiJS-based logic adapted into VR  
- Right-click (or VR equivalent) JSON input popup to render icons, shapes, and block elements  
- Foundation for building VR educational and design tools
